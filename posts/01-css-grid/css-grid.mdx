# Working with CSS grid.


### 1. What is a grid?

A network of lines that cross each other to form a series of squares or rectangles.

### 2. What is CSS grid?


CSS Grid is a powerful tool that allows for 2-dimensional layouts to be created on the web. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handel layout in row and columns.


### 3. Basic terminologies.
 
**1. Container :-** A section or a division in which we want to work CSS grid(or rows and columns). We create a div container by setting the CSS display property to grid.
 ex.
 
```css
 
.container{display:grid; 
}
 ```
 
**2. grid-template-columns :-** A CSS property to specify number of columns and their width. The width can be any no negative CSS length value like fr, %, px, em, etc. 
The best practice is to use fr(fraction) for responsiveness. 
 We can use **grid-template-rows** too  for specifing rows but in this blog we are going to use the column approach.

 We do this by setting CSS property of our container as grid-template-columns to the width values.
 
ex. 
 
```css
 
.container{ 
    
	display:grid;
  
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr 1fr
 
}
 ```
  
**3. grid-area :-** This property is used to specify the location and size of an item inside the container.
  
We specify a name for every items to use inside our grid-template-area (We will learn this next.)
  
We set the property grid-area with a name to each items we want to use inside our container.
 In this exapmle we have 5 items as Navigation-Bar ,Main, Left-Side-Item, Right-Side-Item and Footer. We give all of them a name as
 
 ```css
  
.navbar{grid-area:navbar}
  ```

**4. grid-template-areas :-** The last and most important step is to specify our layout in term of rows and columns,
 and we do this by using grid-template-areas inside our container as
  
```css

.container{
  
display:grid;
  
grid-template-columns:1fr 3fr 1fr;
  
grid-template-areas:"navbar navbar navbar"
   
                      "leftSide main rightSide"

                       "footer footer footer";
    
}
```
 
*Note : We use the name specified grid-area inside our grid template area.*

We use Media Queries to change the layout on diffrent screen sizes by changing the grid-template-areas.

#### Implementation
 
We are going to implement a simple 5 component layout as

***Desktop View***

***Mobile View***

**Step 0 :- Basic Html** 

```html
    <div class="container">

        <div class="navbar">

            NavBar

        </div>

        <div class="main">

            Main

        </div>

        <div class="leftSide">

            Left  Side

        </div>

        <div class="rightSide">

            Right Side

        </div>

        <div class="footer">

            Footer

        </div>

    </div>

```

**Step 1 :- CSS**

```css

/*Creating grid-template-columns and grid-template-areas*/

.container{

    display: grid;

    grid-template-columns:1fr 3fr 1fr ;

    grid-template-areas:"navbar navbar navbar"

                        "leftSide main rightSide"

                        "footer footer footer";

    }

/*specifing grid-areas*/
.navbar{ grid-area: navbar; }

.main{ grid-area: main; }

.leftSide{ grid-area: leftSide; }

.rightSide{ grid-area: rightSide; }

.footer{ grid-area: footer; }

```

*This is it for our desktop view but for our mobile view let's add media query*

```css
 
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px)
 {

 .container{

    grid-template-columns:1fr;

    grid-template-areas:"navbar"

                        "main"

                        "leftSide"

                        "rightSide"

                        "footer";

 }
```
